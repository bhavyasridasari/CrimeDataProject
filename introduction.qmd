## Abstract
This project embarks on a comprehensive investigation into crime data spanning from 2020 to the present, meticulously sourced from the public data catalog. The central aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and significant insights into crime occurrences and victim demographics. The analysis focuses on understanding the dynamics between factors such as age, sex, crime severity, and geographical distribution. Employing advanced statistical methods and diverse visualization techniques, this project tackles crucial research questions designed to illuminate the complexities of criminal activity. By doing so, it provides valuable insights for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and community organizations, contributing to informed decision-making and fostering proactive crime prevention strategies. Ultimately, this study aspires to enhance societal understanding of crime patterns and support measures aimed at reducing crime and ensuring public safety.

## Project Dataset Details
The dataset utilized for this project originates from the [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). It encompasses detailed records of crimes reported during the specified period, providing a rich resource for examining various dimensions of criminal activity. To ensure analytical rigor, the dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing to remove inconsistencies, anomalies, and irrelevant data points.

### Dataset Composition and Key Fields

1. **Victim Characteristics:** Encompasses demographic details such as age and sex, critical for understanding victim profiles.
2. **Crime Classifications:** Categorizes criminal activities into severe and non-severe types to gauge their gravity and societal impact.
3. **Geographical Data:** Includes information on zones and premises descriptions, offering spatial insights into crime distribution.

#### Key Fields Integral to the Analysis
- **Vict.Sex:** Indicates the gender of the victim, classified as Male or Female.
- **Vict.Age:** Specifies the victim's age at the time of the incident.
- **Crm.Cd.Desc:** Describes the nature or category of the crime committed.
- **Premis.Cd.Desc:** Details the location or premises where the crime occurred.
- **Severe:** A binary indicator (1 for Severe, 0 for Non-Severe) to classify crime severity.

## Purpose of the Study
The primary goal of this project is to analyze crime trends, focusing on their relationship with victim demographics and situational factors. The specific objectives include:

1. **Spatial Analysis:** Examine the frequency and distribution of crimes across various zones and premises to identify high-risk areas.
2. **Demographic Vulnerabilities:** Investigate age-related susceptibilities in relation to severe and non-severe crimes, highlighting at-risk groups.
3. **Gender Disparities:** Explore differences in victimization rates between males and females, particularly concerning severe crimes.
4. **Age-Crime Relationship:** Assess how victim age influences the total number of crimes reported for each gender.

Through these analyses, the study aims to generate actionable insights that can assist stakeholders in designing targeted interventions and policies, ultimately contributing to public safety and community well-being. This project stands as a robust effort to bridge data-driven insights with practical applications in crime prevention and societal protection.
